Original plugin by Ozh: [Word Based Short Urls](https://github.com/ozh/yourls-word-based-short-urls)

## What for

Generate memorable "short" URLs with adjectives and nouns, such as `http://yoursite/BronzeWordyTurtle` (well, they will be less shorter, but more memorable :)


## How to

* In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `fancy-animals-short-urls` or simply `git clone https://github.com/cfultz/Fancy-Animal-Short-Urls` there
* Drop these files in that directory (skip if you git clone instead)
* Go to the Plugins administration page and activate the plugin 
* Have fun


## FAQ

1. "it doesn't work!"
	* Sorry, it does for me.

2. "Can I customize the words ?"
	* Sure. Replace the three text files with your own, one word per line.


## License

Do whatever the hell you want with it.
